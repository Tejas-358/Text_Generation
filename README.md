# LSTM Text Generation Model

This repository contains code for a text generation model built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) in Python. The model is trained on a dataset and can generate text based on the patterns it learns from the training data.

## Project Overview

This project uses Python and Keras to demonstrate how to build an LSTM-based text generation model from scratch. The model is trained on a dataset to predict the next character in a sequence, allowing it to generate coherent text based on the patterns it learns.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the text of ["Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt), downloaded from Project Gutenberg.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)
- Requests (for downloading the dataset)

## Files

- `text_generation_lstm.py`: Python script containing the code for training the LSTM model.
- `README.md`: This file, provides an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/

2. Clone the repository:

Run the training script

## Results
The trained model can generate text that resembles the style and structure of the input text dataset. Example outputs can be found in the generated output during the script execution.
